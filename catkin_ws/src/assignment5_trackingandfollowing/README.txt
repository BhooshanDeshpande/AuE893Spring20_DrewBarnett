#################################### OVERVIEW OF CONTENT ####################################

The contents of this package include the turtlebot implementations of the following 3 tasks:

1. Line following in Gazebo
2. Line following in real world
3. Apriltag following in real world 

#################################### HOW TO RUN EACH PART ###################################

1. Line following (Gazebo): 

	(In Gazebo): Open terminal, run "roslaunch assignment5_trackingandfollowing gazebo_follow_line.launch"  

2. Line following (turtlebot): 
	
	(On remote PC): Open a terminal, run "roscore"
	(On remote PC): Open a new terminal for turtlebot commands, run "ssh pi@<raspberry_pi_ipv4>"

	(On turtlebot): Bringup the turtlebot, "roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_rpicamera.launch"
	(On turtlebot): Open new terminal, "roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch"
	
	(On remote PC): Open terminal, run "roslaunch assignment5_trackingandfollowing turtlebot3_follow_line.launch"

#################################### DESCRIPTION OF EACH PART ###############################

1. Line following:

This code focuses on handout7, which aims to implement line following code for the turtlebot both in Gazebo and in the real world. To do this, changes had to be made in follow_line_step_hsv.py. First, a twist object was created so that commands for the turtlebot movement could be published to /cmd_vel. Then, a proportional steering controller was implemented fed by the error produced between the calculated centroid of the yellow line in the image frame to the center of the image frame in the x direction. Arguments in the launch files include the proportional gain for the steering controller, kp.  

2. Apriltag following:

This code utilizes an external apriltag_ros package, which provides code that enables april tag detection. Before carrying out apriltag detection, however, the camera on the turtlebot was calibrated and saved onto the device firmware. Once the camera was calibrated, the following steps specified in part 2 above were carried out for each new session with the turtebot.
