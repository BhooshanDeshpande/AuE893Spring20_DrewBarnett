Hello everyone! 

My name is Drew Barnett, and I am currently a 1st year student at Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research. I aspire to work in the automotive industry in the field of autonomy. I hope that I may help build a future comprised of safe and efficient mobility for all people. 

In this repository, you'll find various projects of mine as I progress through this Spring semester.
